One of the hurdles of learning a new language is not knowing where to get started. In this writing I cover what I would do if I was to start and learn Turkish all over again. Stay tuned!

First of all let me talk about the mental model required that more or less applies to learning any language.

### 1. Approach with a mindset of a five year old.

You can apply this approach in order to learn the alphabet of the the language and basic words like `car, apple, tree, socks, jacket, chair, table...` and the like.

<aside>
🔑 One thing you should pay attention to learn or ask(if you have someone) as many questions as possible and **map** this words to the language you are comfortable with the most.

</aside>

Coming back to Turkish, learn daily used words and associate the context of how you learned it. Eventually you would forget and re-learn words but you know the words you will not forget, the words you remember how you came to learn them. 

To illustrate this,

> On my first night in Turkey, I learned `hot` in Turkish was `sıcak (/sɯ.ˈdʒɑk/)` when I was offered a hot tea. Intuitively `cold` follows as soğuk.
> 

From the above example I can introduce some things about Turkish.

1. There is a letter `ı` → `“i” without the dot`  
2. The letter `c` in Turkish  is like the `j` in English.
3. Whenever you see `ğ` → “soft `g`“, read the word like `ğ` did not exist. Just ignore it. 

<aside>
🔑 A popular example to see the above three concepts in action leads as to look at the name of The president of Türkiye.
His name is usually mispronounced by international journalist. 
`Recep Tayyip Erdoğan` → It is pronounced as “Rejeb Tayyip Erdo_an”

### 2. What is Turkish actually Like?

Turkish is an agglutinative language. The word agglutinative comes from the Latin verb 𝘢𝘨𝘨𝘭𝘶𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘢𝘳𝘦 meaning to glue together. Words in Turkish generally have a root and a suffix. The suffix determines the tense, or whether if it is a verb or a noun.

So you can approach learning Turkish like solving a jigsaw puzzle.

### 3. Back to the root

Most of the thing you do when learning Turkish is visually breaking down words to their basic constituents — the root and the suffix(s).  

<aside>
📝 Let us see this in play, 

The sentence “You will learn Turkish” translates to “Siz Türkçe öğrenecksiniz.”

Siz → You
Türkçe → Turkish 
— *You see Turkish came before the verb “to learn” → The sentence structure in Turkish  is  — Subject + Object + Verb* 
Öğreneceksiniz → You will learn

</aside>

Let us break “öğrenecksiniz” into its root and suffixes.

- What is the verb in the first place?
    - **öğrenmek (to learn)**
     Verbs in Turkish have the ending “**mak or mek**” after the **root.**
- What is the root of the verb?
    - **öğren (learn)**
        
        You get the **root** by removing the **“mak or mek”** from the **verb.**
        
- The suffixes.
    - -ecek
        - It makes it future tense
    - -siniz
        - It ends with siniz since it started with Siz(**plural you**) it has to end in a way that is in **agreement** with the **Subject**( Siz → You 🙃). 
        Siz Türkçe öğreneceksiniz →  You will learn Turkish

<aside>
📌 You can be overwhelmed by the above example — what I say to you making such dissections only makes sense after learning about verbs, tenses and building good library of words.

</aside>

<aside>
📌 I want you to know like many things in Life **Turkish grammar** also makes sense in **hindsight**. You enjoy it coming back understanding why it had to be that way. The above example is just to help you find out if you find the challenge interesting enough to learn more.
